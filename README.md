## Introduction
This repository contains a project that predicts the survival of passengers on the Titanic. 
The analysis is performed using the Titanic dataset, which includes information about passengers such as age, gender, class, and more. 
The machine learning model is built using logistic regression.

## Features
Data preprocessing and cleaning
Exploratory data analysis
Feature engineering
Model training using logistic regression
Model evaluation
Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Model Details
Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, feature scaling.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizations to understand the distribution and relationships in the data.
Feature Engineering: Creating new features from existing ones to improve model performance.
Model Training: Using logistic regression from the scikit-learn library to train the model.
Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
